# CoverageRecommendation

**Use Case**
        •	With the advent of 5G and high speed network, one of most important giveaway to customers by any telecom is an assurance of an optimized network
        •	Data-driven insights from various subsystem from OSS help to monitor equipment & network, learn from historical information & anticipate optimization in network coverage           for fallout co-ordinates candidates
**Solution**
    •	ML and Deep Learning algorithms can digest the data from Core N/W, N/W Performance System, N/W Planning and N/W inventory and develop an insight of issues or improvement in        comparison to data reported N/W Monitoring and Customer / Service Operations teams
    •	E.g.: If a customer is geographically located at Dense Urban zone then he/she should receive a signal level & data speed of Dense Urban or Urban based upon the N/W                 technology as:
        •	5GNR : Dense Urban Signal Level  69 to -101 dBm & Data Speed  -- 30000 kbps
        •	LTE : Dense Urban Signal Level  -60 dbm to -70 dbm & Data Speed – 3000 Kbps
        •	UMTS : Dense Urban Signal Level  -71dbm to -90 & Data Speed --1500 Kbps

      If the above assumption contradicts between the N/W Planning and Monitoring then ML Model backtracks into various OSS subsystem to identify the probable cause in                   configuration & data so as to provide an early eye to proactively optimize the network Coverage and OSS subsystems

**Business Metrics (Net Promoter Score & Customer service effectiveness)**
    •	Proactively fixing issues such as no  / low coverage, unintentional marking of a live cell tower state etc. before they happen will contribute to increase Customer                 satisfaction on the operator.

**Implementation Dependencies**
    •	Data sources from various OSS systems like Core N/W, N/W Performance System, N/W Planning and N/W inventory
